1. Take input from user (Starting point, destination, priority rank for Carbon-footprint, distance, cost, time)

2. Make request to Maps api to get information about the list of routes (including ferries, flights, drives, walks, etc).
ctd: more requests may need to be made if you decide to split the route up into multiple pieces, so you can route not point 
a->b but from a->c c->d d->b with different transportion modes used for each leg of the journey.

3. Data set 1: Collect information and compute the carbon footprint for the entire route, plus information on distance, time, cost, etc.

Data set 2: Collect & compute information on how to offset carbon footprint for ride (with number of trees planted, walking/cycling/using public transport for X miles. 

4. present data set 1 on GUI to the user in the form of an interactive graph

5. present data set 2 pictographically with trees/car routes/etc.

bottom: Search another route. 

# PREFERENTIAL SEARCH ALGORITHM

1. calculate and store the cost, distance, carbon footprint and the time for all of the routes generated by the user's input of starting point and destination.

2. Based on the priority choices of the user, find the route that corresponds to their 1st priority and fits that data set the best. (Let's only worry about option 1; the rest we can sort of wing-by).

3. Push data of the top route to the user's pie chart information page. 

after results are generated and pushed to the screen for the user to see, an option at the bottom of the screen is used to help users select a different priority ranking for a different travel route.
